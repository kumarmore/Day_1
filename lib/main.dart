//1. Real-World Problems Solved Using Programming

// E-commerce Applications: Automating inventory management and order processing.
// Weather Forecasting: Using data analysis to predict weather patterns.

//2. Difference Between final and const in Dart
// final: A variable declared with final is initialized only once and can hold a runtime constant value.
// const: A variable declared with const is a compile-time constant and must be assigned a value at compile time.


//3. AREA OF CIRCLE
// double calculateArea(double radius) {
//   return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
// }
//
// void main() {
//   double radius = 5.0;
//   double area = calculateArea(radius);
//   print('The area of the circle with radius $radius is $area.');
// }

//4.Difference Between for and while Loops and When to Use Them

// for Loop: Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
// while Loop: Used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.
